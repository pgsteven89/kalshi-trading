# Market Mapping Configuration
# Maps ESPN events to Kalshi market tickers

# Pattern-based matching
patterns:
  # NFL games follow this pattern
  - sport: nfl
    event_format: "{away_team} at {home_team}"
    kalshi_format: "NFL-{game_id}-{team}"

  # NBA games
  - sport: nba
    event_format: "{away_team} at {home_team}"
    kalshi_format: "NBA-{game_id}-{team}"

  # College Football
  - sport: college-football
    event_format: "{away_team} at {home_team}"
    kalshi_format: "CFB-{game_id}-{team}"

# Explicit mappings for special cases
# Use when automatic pattern matching doesn't work
explicit: []
  # Example:
  # - espn_event_id: "401547417"
  #   kalshi_ticker: "NFL-2426-KC"
